## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome, encouraged, and compensated. For more details, see [lbry.io/faq/contributing](https://lbry.io/faq/contributing)

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Releases](https://github.com/lbryio/lbryumx/releases) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions.

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be run with: `py.test -v`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built, and that unit and sanity tests are automatically run.
